instruction: |-
  You are given W&B logs from several reinforcement learning runs of LLMs at https://wandb.ai/mbzuai-llm/Guru?nw=nwuserz6cheng. Identify the number of validation benchmarks in "val" section, where clip-high=0.28, a method adopted in the RL for reasoning paper DAPO, can provide clear performance gain over baseline (w/o clip-high=0.28) on 32B model.

  **Clear Gain Definition:**

  We assume "clear gain" on one benchmark if given run A and B:

  ```
  max_validation_score(run_A) - max_validation_score(run_B) > 0.02
  ```

  Where run A uses clip-high=0.28 and run B is the baseline without clip-high.

  **Output Format:**

  ```
  <answer>5</answer>
  ```

  Answer with the number of validation benchmarks satisfying the requirement (single integer).
